# Dasymetric Mapping of Population Change at the Building Level (2011–2022)

This repository contains data, Python scripts, and visual outputs related to the study of building-level population change in a rural settlement in Southeastern Serbia. The project applies dasymetric mapping techniques, spatial statistics, and exploratory spatial data analysis to examine patterns of residential depopulation and intensification.
